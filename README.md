# Git Interview Questions
Welcome to the Git Repository Guide! This repository is designed to provide comprehensive guidance and best practices for using Git effectively. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find useful information to enhance your Git skills.

## Introduction
Git is a powerful version control system used to manage code changes across projects of all sizes. This repository aims to provide clear and concise information to help you navigate and master Git.

## Getting Started
To get started with Git, follow these steps:
1. Install Git: [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Configure Git: 
    ```sh
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    ```
3. Initialize a repository:
    ```sh
    git init
    ```

## Basic Commands
Here are some fundamental Git commands:
- `git clone <repository-url>`: Clone an existing repository
- `git add <file>`: Add files to staging area
- `git commit -m "commit message"`: Commit changes
- `git push`: Push changes to the remote repository
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository

## Branching and Merging
Learn how to manage branches and merge changes:
- Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
- Switch branches: `git checkout <branch-name>`
- Merge branches: `git merge <branch-name>`

## Advanced Techniques
Explore advanced Git techniques:
- Rebase: `git rebase <branch-name>`
- Stash changes: `git stash`
- Cherry-pick: `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`

## Best Practices
Follow these best practices to ensure smooth collaboration:
- Commit frequently with meaningful messages
- Keep branches small and focused
- Use pull requests for code reviews

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have a question or improvement that you think should be included, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution.
3. Add your question or improvement in the appropriate category folder (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`).
