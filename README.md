## Getting Started
To get started with Git, follow these steps:
1. Install Git: [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Configure Git: 
    ```sh
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    ```
3. Initialize a repository:
    ```sh
    git init
    ```

## Basic Commands
Here are some fundamental Git commands:
- `git clone <repository-url>`: Clone an existing repository
- `git add <file>`: Add files to staging area
- `git commit -m "commit message"`: Commit changes
- `git push`: Push changes to the remote repository
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository

## Branching and Merging
Learn how to manage branches and merge changes:
- Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
- Switch branches: `git checkout <branch-name>`
- Merge branches: `git merge <branch-name>`

## Advanced Techniques
Explore advanced Git techniques:
- Rebase: `git rebase <branch-name>`
- Stash changes: `git stash`
- Cherry-pick: `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`

## Best Practices
Follow these best practices to ensure smooth collaboration:
- Commit frequently with meaningful messages
- Keep branches small and focused
- Use pull requests for code reviews

### 2. How do you initialize a new Git repository?

To initialize a new Git repository, navigate to your project directory and use the following command:

```sh
git init
```

This command creates a new `.git` subdirectory in your project directory, which contains all the necessary metadata for the repository.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**

### 3. How do you clone a repository?

To clone an existing repository, use the following command:

```sh
git clone <repository_url>
```

For example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git
```

This command creates a new directory with the name of the repository and copies all the repository data into it.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

### 4. What is the command to check the status of your working directory?

To check the status of your working directory, use:

```sh
git status
```

This command shows which files have been modified, which files are staged for commit, and which files are not being tracked by Git.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

### 5. How do you stage a file for commit?

To stage a file for commit, use:

```sh
git add <file_name>
```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

### 11. What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?

- `git pull` fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your current branch.
- `git fetch` only downloads changes from a remote repository but does not merge them into your current branch.

Example:

```sh
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
```

is equivalent to:

```sh
git pull origin main
```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**

Example of `git reset`:

```sh
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

Example of `git revert`:

```sh
git revert HEAD
```

# Medium Git Interview Questions and Answers
### 1. What is a Git repository?

A Git repository is a storage space where your project files and their history of changes are stored. It includes all the project‚Äôs files and the entire history of changes made to those files, which allows you to track versions, revert to previous states, and collaborate with others.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

### 2. Explain the difference between a local and remote repository.

- **Local Repository**: A repository stored on your local machine. You interact with this repository using Git commands.
- **Remote Repository**: A repository hosted on a remote server. It is often used for collaboration where multiple users push and pull changes.

For example, you clone a remote repository to create a local copy on your machine.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

### 3. What is a commit hash?

A commit hash is a unique identifier for a specific commit in the Git history. It's a 40-character SHA-1 hash that ensures each commit can be uniquely identified.

Example of a commit hash:

```
e1a1d3e8b8e3a1b5a1f3c1c8d8e8d8c8c8c8d8d8
```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

### 4. How do you resolve merge conflicts?

To resolve merge conflicts:
1. Identify the files with conflicts using `git status`.
2. Open the conflicting files and manually resolve conflicts.
3. Stage the resolved files using `git add <file_name>`.
4. Commit the resolved changes using `git commit`.

Example:

```sh
git add resolved_file.txt
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in resolved_file.txt"
```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

### 5. Explain the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`.

- **`git merge`**: Combines the changes from one branch into another, creating a merge commit.
  
  ```sh
  git merge feature-branch
  ```

- **`git rebase`**: Moves or combines a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It creates a linear history.

  ```sh
  git rebase main
  ```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---


### 6. How do you stash changes in Git?

To stash changes, use:

```sh
git stash
```

This command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

### 7. How do you apply stashed changes?

To apply stashed changes, use:

```sh
git stash apply
```

Or to both apply and remove the stash:

```sh
git stash pop
```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

### 8. What is the purpose of the `.gitignore` file?

The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories Git should ignore and not track. It helps prevent committing unnecessary files like temporary files, build artifacts, and sensitive information.

Example `.gitignore`:

```
*.log
node_modules/
.env
```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

### 9. How do you revert a commit that has already been pushed to the remote repository?

To revert a pushed commit, use:

```sh
git revert <commit_hash>
```

This creates a new commit that undoes the changes of the specified commit.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

### 10. How do you cherry-pick a commit?

To cherry-pick a commit, use:

```sh
git cherry-pick <commit_hash>
```

This command copies the changes from the specified commit and applies them to your current branch.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

### 11. What is the difference between `git diff` and `git log`?

- **`git diff`**: Shows the changes between commits, branches, files, etc.

  ```sh
  git diff
  ```

- **`git log`**: Shows the commit history.

  ```sh
  git log
  ```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

### 12. How do you create a new branch and push it to the remote repository in one command?

To create a new branch and push it to the remote repository:

```sh
git checkout -b <branch_name> && git push -u origin <branch_name>
```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

### 13. What is `git bisect` and how is it used?

`git bisect` helps you find the commit that introduced a bug by performing a binary search through your commit history.

Example usage:

```sh
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git bisect good <commit_hash>
```

Mark each commit as good or bad until you find the problematic commit.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

### 14. How do you squash commits?

To squash commits, use interactive rebase:

```sh
git rebase -i HEAD~n
```

Replace `pick` with `squash` (or `s`) for the commits you want to squash, then save and close the editor.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

### 15. How do you create a bare repository?

To create a bare repository, use:

```sh
git init --bare <repository_name>.git
```

A bare repository is typically used as a central repository for collaboration.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

### 16. What is a detached HEAD state?

A detached HEAD state occurs when your HEAD is pointing to a commit instead of a branch. This means you are not on any branch.

  ```

- **`--mixed`** (default): Moves HEAD to the specified commit and resets the staging area, but leaves the working directory unchanged.

  ```sh
  git reset --mixed HEAD~1
  ```

- **`--hard`**: Moves HEAD to the specified commit and resets both the staging area and working directory.

  ```sh

# Hard Git Interview Questions and Answers
### 1. What is Git rebasing and what are its advantages and disadvantages?

**Git Rebasing** is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It allows you to maintain a linear project history.

#### Advantages:
- **Clean History**: Rebasing results in a cleaner, more linear commit history.
- **Easier Merging**: Reduces the complexity of the merge process by avoiding merge commits.

#### Disadvantages:
- **History Rewriting**: Can be dangerous if not used carefully, especially with shared branches, as it rewrites commit history.
- **Loss of Context**: Merge commits provide a context of when branches were combined, which is lost with rebasing.

**Example:**

```sh
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--hard)**
---

### 2. How do you perform an interactive rebase?

Interactive rebase allows you to edit, reorder, squash, or drop commits.

**Example:**

```sh
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

This command opens an editor where you can specify actions for the last three commits.

```sh
pick 1234567 Commit message 1
squash 89abcdef Commit message 2
pick fedcba9 Commit message 3
```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--hard)**
---

### 3. How do you handle a situation where you accidentally pushed sensitive information to a public repository?

1. **Remove the sensitive data from history**:

```sh
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch <file_path>' \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

2. **Force-push the changes**:

```sh
git push origin --force --all
```

3. **Invalidate old references**:

```sh
git push origin --force --tags
```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--hard)**
---

4. **Inform collaborators**: Notify all collaborators to re-clone the repository.

### 4. How do you optimize a repository for performance?

- **Garbage Collection**: Run `git gc` to optimize the repository by compressing file history.
- **Pack Files**: Use `git repack` to create more efficient pack files.
- **Prune Unreachable Objects**: Remove unreachable objects with `git prune`.

**Example:**

```sh
git gc --aggressive --prune=now
```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--hard)**
---

### 5. Explain the internal structure of a Git repository.

A Git repository consists of several components:

- **Objects**: Blobs, Trees, Commits, and Tags.
- **Refs**: Branches and Tags.
- **Index**: The staging area.
- **HEAD**: A pointer to the current branch.

**Example:**

```sh
.git/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ objects/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ refs/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ HEAD
```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--hard)**

**Example:**

1. **Install Git LFS**:

```sh
git lfs install
```

2. **Track large files**:

```sh
git lfs track "*.bin"
```

3. **Add and commit**:

```sh
git add .gitattributes
git add largefile.bin
git commit -m "Add large file using LFS"
git push
```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--hard)**

### 7. What is the purpose of the `git fsck` command?

`git fsck` checks the integrity of the Git repository, identifying any corrupted objects.

**Example:**

```sh
git fsck
```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--hard)**
---

### 8. How do you clean up a repository with a large history?

Use `git filter-branch` to rewrite history and remove unwanted data.

**Example:**

```sh
git filter-branch --prune-empty --tree-filter 'rm -rf unnecessary_directory' -- --all
```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--hard)**
---

### 9. Explain the concept of Git object model (blobs, trees, commits, etc.).

- **Blobs**: Store file data.
- **Trees**: Represent directories and contain pointers to blobs and other trees.
- **Commits**: Hold metadata and pointers to tree objects and parent commits.
- **Tags**: Annotated tags provide metadata for a specific commit.
